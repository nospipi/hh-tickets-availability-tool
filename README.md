# HH E-Tickets Availability Tool

The HH E-Tickets Availability Tool helps travel agents who used to log into the Ministry of Tourismâ€™s website with a business account to check available time slots at Greek archaeological sites. They had to buy tickets with open dates and manually choose specific days and times to see what was available and plan their visits.
This tool makes it easier by letting users choose a single date or a range of dates for any Greek archaeological site in the time-slots program and see availability instantly with automatic refresh. Future updates will add features like tracking specific dates and times, with email or SMS alerts when availability changes based on user preferences
